## Searching

Taken from [Finding a Word in Vi/Vim](http://ccm.net/faq/982-finding-a-word-in-vi-vim)

To find a word in Vi/Vim, simply type the / or ? key, followed by the word you're searching for.

Once found, you can press the n key to go directly to the next occurrence of the word.

Vi/Vim also allows you to launch a search on the word over which your cursor is positioned. To do this, place the
cursor over the term, and then press * or # to look it up.
