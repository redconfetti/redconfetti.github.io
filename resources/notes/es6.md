[Javascript Fundamentals for ES6](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-fundamentals-es6/table-of-contents)

Javascript is an implementation of ECMAScript. The ES6 specification
that defines the language was in draft status, with release in June 2015.

ES6 introduces an extensive amount of new syntax to the language.
The last time the specification tried to add this broadly to the language
was with ECMAScript 4, but that project was abandoned.

Some modifications were made with [ECMAScript 5 / ES2009](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp).
