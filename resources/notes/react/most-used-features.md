Notes from [React Hooks - Most Used Features]

[react hooks - most used features]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9M9CGSd69I

This tutorial picks up where the [YouTube Clone](./youtube-clone/) tutorial
leaves off.

You can clone my
[Github repository](https://github.com/redconfetti/react-youtube-clone) and
checkout v1.0 like so:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:redconfetti/react-youtube-clone.git
git checkout v1.0
```

## Current State of React

Possibilities that current React components offer us.

- Class based components
  - Smart
  - Manage state
  - Have access to lifecycle methods
- Function based components
  - Quite Stupid
  - Do nothing but return some JSX

Often you'll start with a function based component, and once you realize you
need to manage the state, or have access to lifecycle methods, you have to
refactor your component to be a Class based component.
