The following is a series of articles I worked on in mid 2011, meant to provide
a guide for someone new to web development that wished to start with Ruby on
Rails. As a whole the course is incomplete, but some of the articles still could
provide value to those who stumble upon them. If you wish to use the articles to
help yourself get started, feel free to use my contact page to let me know. I'm
willing to clean these up a bit, and finish the course with your help, if I know
that you wish to use them.

The course was not intended to provide instruction on
[HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/),
[CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), or
[Javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). I expect that you can
purchase books on these subjects, or even refer to W3Schools links I've just
provided to learn more about those languages. HTML and CSS are definitely needed
as prerequisites to working with Ruby on Rails. HTML is easy enough to learn.
CSS just takes a little bit of experience and time to pick up and work with
fluently. I'm still learning Javascript, even though I have a working knowledge
of it, so it's not a total requirement to jump into the world of web
development.

It might be a bit simpler to start people out with a server side language such
as PHP, but I'm interested in helping people dive right into a website
development framework (Rails) that is based on an even more flexible and
beautiful language known as Ruby.

The course provided by this site provides an explanation of the concepts which
experienced web developers are already aware of, and thus provide the
prerequisite material needed for a person to jump into a book on Ruby on Rails
without being completely lost. In the case of this site, the articles are
intended to serve as the prerequisite for the
[Rails 3 In Action](http://www.manning.com/katz/) book by Ryan Bigg and Yehuda
Katz, which are available in print or ebook versions.
