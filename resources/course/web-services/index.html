<h2>Web Services</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service" target="_blank">Web services</a> are software systems designed to allow for communication between two separate systems on a network, or more specifically in this case - the Internet. Often a website will refer to it's web services as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">Application Programming Interface (API)</a>, as the web service isn't strictly intended to be used by other websites, but also with desktop applications. For instance <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter's developers website</a> refers to it's programmer integration options as an API.</p>
<p>The dominant protocol adopted earlier for web services was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank">SOAP</a>, however most web applications developed with "Web 2.0" standards in mind are adopting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">RESTful interfaces</a> which correlate with the HTTP methods discussed above.</p>
<h2>RESTful Web Services</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web, and thus HTTP, was originally designed to provide a full suite of methods for the creation, reading, updating, and destroying (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank">CRUD</a>) of resources on the web. As such newer website applications are adopting the use of web services/APIs which use HTTP and principles of a software architecture style known as Representational state transfer (REST), known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services" target="_blank">RESTful Web API</a>.</p>
<p>A RESTful Web API simply provides an interface for managing resources provided by a web application using the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, while supporting various data types for communication such as XML, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" target="_blank">YAML</a>.</p>
<p>When you are creating a new set of resource management options in a Ruby on Rails application, it's possible to define the requests which are possible with a certain resource as a RESTful resource that can be managed via a typical web  browser interface, or as a RESTful Web API, thus killing two birds with one stone. More on this will be covered in detail in the article on Rails Routing.</p>
