This guide is oriented around applying the "infrastructure as code" methodology
to your local development environment, with the goal of creating a Github
repository that will facilitate the setup and maintenance of your development
environment.

This guide provides steps based on the setup of an Amazon Linux EC2 instance
connected to the [Amazon Cloud9 Web-based IDE]. I've chosen this environment
for this guide to ensure the commands below will consistently work for you,
and also because of the low cost. It is [free for new Amazon AWS users] for 12
months, or less than $10 per month to those using a `t2.micro` EC2 instance that
is turned off by Cloud9 after 30 minutes of non-activity.

This guide assumes that you already have an [Amazon Cloud9 environment setup]
with an EC2 instance running the default Amazon Linux distribution based on
Red-Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It also assumes that you have experince with
[Git].

After you are finished with this guide, you should be able to use the
configuration you have established to maintain your development environment,
as well as automate the setup of a new development environment in the event
that your EC2 instance is terminated/destroyed.

You will also be able to continue beyond this guide in configuring additional
systems to host your website or other applications, as well as automating
deployment of software updates to those systems.

# Ansible

[Ansible] is a an open-source tool you can use to install and configure
software on your Linux systems, as well as deploy new software updates.

Ansible is programmed in Python, however you do not need to know Python to use
it. You may need to gain an understanding of [YAML], [Jinja templates], and read
the [Ansible Project Documentation].

This guide will use Ansible to setup and maintain your local development
environment.

## A Note About Idempotency

Ansible is designed to be used to maintain your systems in an Idempotent manner.
This means that you can run commands with Ansible that will always bring about
the desired outcome, no matter how many times you run them.

Ansible does this by checking if an aspect of your system is in the desired
state currently, and only if it is not does it make the required change to the
system.

It is possible that with certain practices you can run into an issue known as
"configuration drift". Refer to [Ansible Idempotency and Configuration Drift]
for more information on avoiding this issue.

# Establishing a Git repository

You want to establish a [new Github repository] to store your Ansible
configuration. After you've done this, use Git to clone the repository
into your local environment.

Here's the command I used with [my own repository]:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:redconfetti/cloud9-dev.git
```

[new Github repository]: https://github.com/new
[my own repository]: https://github.com/redconfetti/cloud9-dev 

# Installing the Ansible Engine

Here are some of the commands to install Ansible on common Linux distributions.
I'm including the Amazon Linux compatible command first, but including others.

```bash
# Install for RHEL, CentOS, or Amazon Linux
sudo yum install ansible

# Install for Fedora
sudo dnf install ansible

# Configure PPA and Install for Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get install ansible
```

Next setup a script in your own repository to run initial
setup commands (`setup.sh`).
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Update OS
sudo yum update

# Install Ansible for RHEL, CentOS, or Amazon Linux
sudo yum install ansible
```

Use Git to make the script executable.
```bash
git add --chmod=+x setup.sh
```

See [Ansible Installation Guide] for other system installation instructions.

[Ansible Installation Guide]: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

# Ansible Configuration

The default Ansible configuration file is located under
`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`. A `.ansible.cfg` file located in your home directory
can also be configured to over-ride these defaults.

Ansible is designed to be used from a specific machine that is designated as the
"management node" that is used to orchestrate the setup and configuration of
many other machines. This is why the default configurations exist globally
under `/etc/ansible`.

We want Ansible to use the files stored in our Git repository, so create a
new `ansible.cfg` file in the root folder of the new repository.

```
[defaults]
inventory = hosts.yml
```

When running Ansible commands from the root directory of our repository, it will
also over-ride the default and user-specific configurations, but keep in mind
that this method can introduce a security risk.

See Ansible Configuration Documentation:

- [Avoiding security risks with ansible.cfg in the current directory]
- [Configuring Ansible]
- [Ansible Configuration Settings]
- [ansible-config]

[ansible-config]: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-config.html

# Ansible Inventory

Ansible is able to manage the state of multiple machines. By default, the
inventory is defined in `/etc/ansible/hosts` using a format similar to an
[INI file]. Alternatively you can use a YAML file to define your inventory.

As you saw above, we configured Ansible to recognize the `hosts.yaml` file
located in the root directory of the repository.

Create that file now with the following contents that defines the local
machine as 'local'.
```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    local:
      ansible_host: localhost
      ansible_connection: local
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python27
```

# Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands

Ansible is designed to connect to each host using SSH key authentication,
run the commands necessary, and then output the results of each task in the
output of the command line. Because we're configured to connect to our local
system, we do not have to worry about SSH connections or configuration.

Ansible can be used to perform checks against hosts using a single command
line command, known as an 'ad-hoc' command.

Run the command `ansible all -m ping` and you should see the following.
```bash
$ ansible all -m ping
local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

Now we're ready to get started with the actual configuration.

See [Introduction To Ad-Hoc Commands]

[Introduction To Ad-Hoc Commands]: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_adhoc.html

# Ansible Playbooks

Ad-hoc commands are useful, but playbooks are where we can define the state of
our system(s).

Much like the `hosts.yml` file defined above, playbooks are defined in YAML
format. YAML is not a programming language, but a format for storing
information. In this case the information is our configuration that Ansible
modules are defined to interpret and apply to certain hosts.

A playbook can contain one or more "plays" that applies a certain state known
as a "role" to a group of hosts. A role is represented by one or more tasks
performed by an Ansible module.

The Amazon Linux distribution used by the EC2 instance uses a package manager
called Yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified). Ansible provides the [Yum module] to
use this package manager to install or update the software on the host.

Create a file named `local.yml` with the following contents.
```yaml
---
# This playbook deploys the entire setup to the Cloud9 development environment.
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: upgrade all packages
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
```

Run the following command to run this playbook against the local environment.

```bash
ansible-playbook local.yml
```

```shell
TASK [upgrade all packages] ****************************************************
fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "The Python 2 bindings
for rpm are needed for this module. If you require Python 3 support use the
`dnf` Ansible module instead.. The Python 2 yum module is needed for this
module. If you require Python 3 support use the `dnf` Ansible module instead."}
        to retry, use: --limit @/home/ec2-user/src/cloud9-dev/local.retry
```

# Modules

Ansible supports many modules. You can view a list of all available modules
by running:

```bash
ansible-doc -l
```

You can read the documentation for a specific module by using the command:

```bash
ansible-doc <module-name>

# View 'hostname' module documentation
ansible-doc hostname
```
