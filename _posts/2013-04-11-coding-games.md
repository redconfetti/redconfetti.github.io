A few weeks ago I heard about this [FightCode][1] website that lets you
program robots that compete against other coders who code their own robots. It
uses Javascript, so it should be accessible to many web developers. They even
have a [Facebook page][2] you can like.

Recently a co-worker also mentioned a new programming game called [NodeWar][4].
It appears to be under development still, but could prove to be awesome.
