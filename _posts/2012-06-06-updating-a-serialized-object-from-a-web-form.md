You may run into a situation where you create some sort of standard Ruby class
that you want to associate with an ActiveRecord model. The [serialize method]
allows you to store an object inside of a text field for an ActiveRecord object.

With Rails 2.3 support for models nested within forms was added, but it's clear
that this support isn't compatible with serialized objects. In my example below
I have a Post model, which represents a simple blog post. The serialized object
is instantiated from a custom class called 'Metadata', which stores metadata for
the post like it's type and version.
<!--more-->

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize(:meta, Metadata)
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :meta
end
```

``` ruby
class Metadata
  # Type of Post
  attr_accessor :type

  # Version of Post
  attr_accessor :version

  # builds new instance using hash
  def initialize(params = {})
    self.errors     = Array.new
    self.type       = params[:type] unless params[:type] == nil
    self.version    = params[:version] unless params[:version] == nil
  end
end
```

I tried to setup the Post to accept nested attributes for my serialized field,
which resulted in the following error:

``` ruby
> post = Post.new
ArgumentError: No association found for name 'serialized_field'. Has it been defined yet?
```

I tried to setup a form using the 'simple_fields_for' method used by
[Simpleform] (the equivalent of [fields_for].

``` ruby
<%= simple_form_for @post do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :title %>
  <%= f.input :body, :as => 'text' %>
  <%= f.simple_fields_for :meta do |m| %>
    <%= m.select :type, options_for_select(@post_types, @post.meta.type) %>
    <%= m.input :version %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

This only resulted in an error with the 'update_attributes' method provided by
ActiveRecord. A more detailed Gist is available [here].

``` ruby
> post.update_attributes(:meta => { :type => 'awesome' })
ActiveRecord::SerializationTypeMismatch: meta was supposed to be a Metadata, but was a Hash
```

This causes me to suspect that Rails is not yet designed to handle the update of
serialized objects via a nested hash included with the parameters submitted by
the form. I can see that what happens is that the nested parameter hash itself
is assigned to the 'meta' field for the object, instead of the values for each
hash key being applied to the custom object.

The solution that works is instead of defining the 'simple_fields_for' block as
part of the parent object which the form is being built for, simply insert it as
its own floating object inside your form. In the above example the
'simple_fields_for' method was called and passed a block within the Post form.
This results in the fields being defined as part of the Post in the HTML form.

``` html
<input id="post_meta_version" name="post[meta][player]" size="50" type="text">
```

Next in your controller, assign/update the parameters for the custom object
separately.

``` ruby
# PUT /posts/1
def update
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])

  respond_to do |format|
    if @post.update_attributes(params[:post])
      # Update Metadata and save again
      @post.meta.update_attributes(params[:metadata])
      @post.save

      format.html { redirect_to @post, notice: 'Post was successfully updated.' }
      format.json { head :no_content }
    else
      format.html { render action: "edit" }
      format.json { render json: @post.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```
