I wanted to apply the robotic voice synthesis to
[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages].

```shell
say -v fred "This place is a message"
say -v fred "and part of a system of messages"
say -v fred "pay attention to it\!"
say -v fred "Sending this message was important to us."
say -v fred "We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture."
say -v fred "This place is not a place of honor."
say -v fred "no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here."
say -v fred "nothing valued is here."
say -v fred "What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us."
say -v fred "This message is a warning about danger."
say -v fred "The danger is in a particular location."
say -v fred "it increases towards a center."
say -v fred "the center of danger is here."
say -v fred "of a particular size and shape, and below us."
say -v fred "The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours."
say -v fred "The danger is to the body, and it can kill."
say -v fred "The form of the danger is an emanation of energy."
say -v fred "The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically."
say -v fred "This place is best shunned and left uninhabited."
```
