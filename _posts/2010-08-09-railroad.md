I just discovered that there is a Ruby gem which generates diagrams based on
Rails models (ActiveRecord). I ran across this website a while back, but
didn't quite connect the dots. I was just reading [an article][1] on placing
models into their own namespace, and I realized that the diagram it uses as an
example was generated using RailRoad.
