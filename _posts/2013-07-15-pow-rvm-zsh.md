I'm using a Rails 3 app, and my colleague updated the RVM config to use Ruby
2.0.0. I was having issues getting POW to work with the app. I'm using ZSH as my
shell also.

The following command resolved my issue.

```shell
rvm env . -- --env > .powenv
```

Props to [Linus on StackOverflow] for this solution.
