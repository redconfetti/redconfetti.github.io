If you need to access a Ruby on Rails session from a PHP application running
under the same domain, you can do this by splitting the string in the cookie
by the '--'. Thanks to Frederick Cheung for [pointing this out][1].

Here is coding I added to my PHP script which was running from a path under
the same domain. Unfortunately the data returned is in Marshal format, and
there isn't a Marshal.load function for PHP to get the values easily.

``` php
$raw_session_string = $_COOKIE['_app_session'];
$data_split = explode ('--' , $raw_session_string);
$encoded_session = $data_split[0];
$marshal_data = base64_decode($encoded_session);
echo "<pre>marshal_data:". print_r($marshal_data,1) ."</pre>\n";
```
