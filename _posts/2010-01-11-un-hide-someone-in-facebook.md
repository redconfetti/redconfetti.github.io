My aunt recently asked me how to un-hide someone from the news feed for her Facebook account.

Like many other people before her, she's pressed the 'Hide' button for someone, then realized it was a mistake...but couldn't find out how to unhide them.

To add someone back to your Facebook news feed, simply scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the 'Edit Options' link for your news feed.

After you've done this, simply click on the 'Add to News Feed' button to add updates regarding one of your friends, or other pages, back to your Facebook news feed.
