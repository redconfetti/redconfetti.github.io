I've been using a Wordpress site for my blog for years, but that has become cumbersome,
especially when you have to deal with your website being exploited due to holes in
one of the many plugins that your site is relying on.

I used to focus on LAMP stack development, and so running my own [cPanel/WHM server](https://cpanel.com/)
was a no brainer. I more recently migrated my tech blog, [Ruby Colored Glasses](http://www.rubycoloredglasses.com/),
from Wordpress to Github Pages. This is nice because the site is hosted for free by Github,
however that's limited to one site per each account.

So I've decided to try to find another cheap low-cost static website solution that works with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

# Neocities

Back in the 90's there used to be a free hosting solution known as GeoCities that hosted many awesome websites
for many people. This is where many people were able to express themselves in their own unique ways, while also
learning HTML.

Neocities hopes to provide the same type of community. For $5 a month you can
[become a Supporter](https://neocities.org/supporter), which earns you the ability to create as many sites as you wish,
use a custom domain with each site, and also use WebDAV to manage files. If you want the same for a lifetime, you can
send them [$100 via Bitcoin](https://neocities.org/supporter/bitcoin).

So my goal at the current moment is to explore if it's possible to generate a website via Jekyll, and then upload
it to one of the Neocities sites.
