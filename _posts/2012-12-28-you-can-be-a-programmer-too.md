I've been telling people to check out [CodeSchool.com](http://www.codeschool.com/) because it has well laid out interactive courses that you can take to learn advanced web development technologies (jQuery, Coffeescript, Rails, etc).

However, it doesn't have the prerequisite courses on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby.

It turns out that [CodeAcademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) covers those languages.

Of course not just anyone can be a web developer, but if you're nerdy and this stuff excites you, then go for it. I have a job working in San Francisco as a professional developer, doing Ruby on Rails programming. No college. Just experience. Just takes will and determination, and the effort to get experience even if it means taking a pay cut for a while.

If you're looking for something a little more low level, like algorithms or an intro to computer science, check out [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/).
