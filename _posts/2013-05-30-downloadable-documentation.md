Some people want to download the documentation for the languages they're using.
This is needed when an internet connection isn't available (like using a laptop
on a plane), or even for the sake of speed.

Here are two sources of downloadable documentation.

* [Ruby on Rails Documentation](http://railsapi.com/)
* [Ruby documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/downloads/)
