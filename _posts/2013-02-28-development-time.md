It seems common that development tasks or projects take much more time than
expected. My manager recently pointed these out to me:

[The 90/90 Rule][1] - "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first
90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code
accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time."

[Hofstadter's Law][2] - "Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you
expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."
