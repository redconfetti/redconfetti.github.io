I forget the proper syntax for a model generation command that includes a
reference to another models id (foreign key).

Here is an example you can use to remember:

``` shell
rails g model Post user:references title:string body:text
```

Since the 'user' model already exists, Rails knows that this should be the
user_id field that it generates. I guess it's not a big deal, you could just
do 'user_id:integer', but what fun is that?
