Recently a developer colleague of mine was asking about diff tools. We let him
know that he can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install a ported version
of the 'diff' tool provided by
[GNU utils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html).

An expensive alternative is [Kaleidoscope app], which looks great but might be
overkill for our purposes.

The good news is that XCode provides a GUI tool called FileMerge, which is also
known as `opendiff` from the command line. You do have to agree to the Xcode/iOS
license, which requires local admin privileges, to use this tool.

``` shell
$ which opendiff
/usr/bin/opendiff
```

It appears to provide a very intuitive GUI representation of the differences.
You can also configure it to be the default merge tool with Git.

``` shell
git config --global merge.tool opendiff
```

If you want to launch FileMerge from the Launcher, you'll need to open the
Applications folder, right-click on XCode, choose to 'Show Package Contents',
then navigate to Contents/Applications. Inside you'll see the FileMerge
application.

If you right-click on FileMerge, you can right-click, choose to 'Make Alias',
then move the alias to your Applications folder.
