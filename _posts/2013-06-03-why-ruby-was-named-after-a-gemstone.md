**Matz:** Ruby is named after the precious gemstone, it's not an
abbreviation of anything. When I started the language project, I was joking with
a friend that the project must be code-named after a gemstone's name
(&agrave;la Perl). So my friend came up with "ruby". It's a short name for a
beautiful and highly valued stone. So I picked up that name, and it eventually
became the official name of the language.
