I've recently became aware of a time management technique known as the
[Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). You time
a period of work for 25 minutes, then take a short break, then do another period
again. This helps you gauge the amount of work you're getting done in a period
of time, and is supposed to help with mental agility.

My friend uses [Vitamin R](http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/) as an app on
his Mac to remind him of how much time he has left during a time period.
