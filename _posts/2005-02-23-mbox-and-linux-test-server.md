Well. I hooked up the MBox last night, and just like before but even more
disappointing, the damn thing is still creating a digital hum and static,
triggered by the movements of the mouse and the processing of programs. I don't
know if its some sort of electrical interference, a bad USB cable, or both.

I hope I can find the solution. The first thing I'm going to do is replace the
cable and try to clean the connectors in the MBox.

I got the web server running on my little Linux test server. I was hosting
[redconfetti.net] on the server that this website is hosted on for a while,
but recently I moved the DNS hosting onto my server, along with
redconfetti.net.

I currently have various videos hosted off this server. They are available
from the old redconfetti.net site - [Misc Videos]

I'm going to continue to work on [redconfetti.net] as a Linux tutorial site. I
want to provide to others the solutions to the obstacles I meet and have
overcome. I don't know if other people will have the same issues I'm having,
and I am trying to read the manual, but oh well.
