I've worked on various projects that used various task management applications
hosted in the cloud (software as a service). I hear about new ones every so
often, so I decided to note them here for future reference.

* [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/) - Anyone trying to adopt the
  agile / scrum method of development has likely used this.
* [BaseCampHQ.com](http://basecamp.com/) - This is the first Rails application.
  The reason Ruby on Rails exists. Simple and elegant.
* [Wrike.com](http://www.wrike.com/) - Very flexible. Can be used to multiple
  people, in different organizations, matching any special hierarchy of tasks.
* [PlanScope.io](https://planscope.io/)
* [Asana.com](http://asana.com/)
