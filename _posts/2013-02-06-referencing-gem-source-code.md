It's often difficult to work with Ruby Gems that your Rails application
depends on because the source code for the gem itself is packed away in a gem
directory. I've often found myself using the command 'rvm gemdir' to output
the path to the gem directory that my application is using, changing to that
directory, and opening the source using Textmate. This is a time consuming
process.

Instead, it's useful to simply unpack a gem into your Rails application so
that it loads from the vendor/gems directory. I'm currently using the
following command to unpack the RefineryCMS gems into my Rails app for
reference.

``` shell
gem unpack refinerycms --version 2.0.9 --target vendor/gems
gem unpack refinerycms-core --version 2.0.9 --target vendor/gems
gem unpack refinerycms-dashboard --version 2.0.9 --target vendor/gems
```

These unpacked gems are not referenced in my Gemfile, so I expect there
shouldn't be any conflicts. The source is just there for my referencing
pleasure.
