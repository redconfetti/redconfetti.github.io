Here are my own notes for using [Yard] to provide the Ruby API documentation and
other notes for your application.

[Yard]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard
<!--more-->

## Installation

First add the Yard gem to your Gemfile, preferably in the development group if
applicable.

``` ruby
group :development do
  # Yard
  # YARD is a Ruby Documentation tool
  # https://github.com/lsegal/yard
  gem "yard", "~> 0.8.7"
end
```

## Running

You can use Yard to generate documentation by just running 'Yard' from the root
of your application.

``` shell
$ yard
Files:          36
Modules:        10 (   10 undocumented)
Classes:        26 (   21 undocumented)
Constants:       0 (    0 undocumented)
Methods:       140 (   54 undocumented)
 51.70% documented
```

You can also run a server that updates dynamically as you add documentation.

``` shell
$ yard server

>> YARD 0.8.7 documentation server at http://0.0.0.0:8808
[2013-08-31 14:28:15] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2013-08-31 14:28:15] INFO  ruby 2.0.0 (2013-06-27) [x86_64-darwin12.4.1]
[2013-08-31 14:28:15] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=41901 port=8808
```

## Configuration

You can run the 'yardoc' command with options that cause it to parse certain
directories for documentation. With Rails applications it appears that this
isn't necessary. Rather than add options or flags after the yard command each
time, you can configure a [.yardopts file] with the arguments you would normally
use from the command line.

Yard will make use of your README.md file as the index page for the
documentation, but to include other files you could configure a .yardopts file
like so:

``` shell
-
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

This makes it possible for the CHANGELOG to show up under the 'File List' section.

I prefer to have my own hierarchy of markdown files in /doc, with generated
documentation in /doc/app. This way I can completed delete the doc/app folder
without affecting my other markup files in the root of /doc.

``` shell
--output-dir doc/app
-
doc/DevelopmentTasks.md
CHANGELOG.md
README.md
```

Here is a good example of a more elaborately [configured .yardopts file]. You
can also run 'yardoc --help' to discover other options to add to the file.
