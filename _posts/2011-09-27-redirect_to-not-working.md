I was just working on a Ruby on Rails controller method that receives
information from the previous form via HTTP POST. I coded it so that if
certain form variables weren't present it would set a flash message and
redirect to the form page. I tried and tried and still the redirect wasn't
working. I reset my web server, and even restarted my computer, but stil this
didn't resolve the issue.

I then realized that perhaps redirects aren't possible with HTTP POST's, only
GET requests. I ended up just creating a generic view for displaying errors,
and will render that view and then 'return FALSE' inside of the if statement
when an error is detected.
