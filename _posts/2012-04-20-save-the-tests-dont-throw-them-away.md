So it's been several weeks since I started using test driven development. I'm
using FactoryGirl instead of fixtures, because I've heard that fixtures are
limiting. I'd rather just write Factories from the beginning. I'm also using
standard Test::Unit based unit and functional tests. Haven't touched on
integration testing yet.

As I've gone along and written these tests, I've learned how to do things
effectively and am carving out my own style.

For instance you could either test for a link with the content 'Edit' on the
page, or you could add an ID or class to the link and test for the presence of
that link with that class. I found that I'd rather do both just to ensure that
the button is or is not present in a certain circumstance.

``` ruby
assert_select "a.btn", { :count => 0, :text => "Edit"}, "Edit button shouldn't be present for sent request"
assert_select "a.btn", { :count => 0, :text => "Delete"}, "Delete button shouldn't be present for sent request"
assert_select "a.edit-request", false, "Edit button shouldn't be present for sent request"
assert_select "a.delete-request", false, "Delete button shouldn't be present for sent request"
```

It may seem like a lot more coding is necessary for the tests than the code
itself which it is testing. This is true, and is one of the reasons I was
leery about writing tests. But here is the thing I wasn't aware of, at least
not in the way I understand it now.

First off, it may look like a lot more code, but really it's just a lot of
duplicated code that varies. Like in the above example, it's really two types
of tests applied to two different buttons on the page. One type tests to
ensure a link with the 'btn' class (used by Twitter Bootstrap) with certain
text content isn't present, and the other checks to make sure a link with a
specific class name isn't present. I did this so that if someone else changes
the text of the button to say 'Edit Request', the class test will still catch
if the link/button is present when it's not supposed to. Now that I have this
type of test in place, when I need it again I can just copy and paste these
tests for the correct syntax, then modify them to meet the needs of the new
page I'm testing. So ultimately, it's not that much more coding. It's kind of
like when a person looks at a mixing console in a recording studio and thinks
"Wow, how can that guy understand what all those knobs and buttons do?". Once
they realize that you just have to understand one column of those knobs and
buttons, and that each other column applied to a different instrument in the
music mix, all of a sudden understanding it becomes extremely simplified. It's
the same thing with testing.

Another point is that you don't have to write tests for every single little
thing. For my application, requests that have been sent to a remote system
later should not be edited or deleted. I don't want people trying to use
buttons that shouldn't be showing on the screen, which is why I wrote the
tests above. I know that I'd receive complaints from the users using the
interface if those buttons are showing, and if they result in error when
someone attempts to use them in the wrong context...or worse if they result in
a sent request being modified, and thus an accurate history for that request
is compromised instead of protected. However I found that when I was editing
one of these requests, and the data I entered was invalid, a select form field
that relied on a collection of options rendered as a text field instead of a
select field. This is one of those special bugs that doesn't necessarily
compromise a core function of the system. It's not going to result in some
major failure or side effect that would warrant a test, so I've chosen to just
fix the bug and move on without a test for that scenario. If the issue does
pop up in practice more than I expect, then I'll write a test to avoid it
happening again, but for now I'm picking and choosing my battles based on my
experience and expectations.

The main point of this post that I wanted to make however is that you're doing
it anyway. If you're not using test driven development, you're testing your
models in the Rails console, or opening your browser and testing the app
within the development environment. For model method testing, once you close
your terminal window the coding you wrote in the IRB console is gone forever.
The same principle of loss applies to browser based tests. You have to adjust
the records in your development environment often, and go through a special
sequence of events just to get the right state in your development environment
with a browser, just to test one single result. This is EXTREMELY time
consuming and laborious. With unit tests you can test the result of each
method, and are actually more likely to implement tests using rare cases you
would be too lazy to test for otherwise. With functional tests, the
environment needed to properly test a specific scenario is much easier to
setup and maintain, and is performed in seconds instead of minutes (or even
hours).

I'm not yet opinionated regarding other testing options such as Rspec,
Cucumber, etc. however I definitely see the benefit of picking up a habit of
writing tests as the solution to a major waste of time later on after your
project has grown. I have much less anxiety regarding unexpected bugs, and I
know that once one is identified it can be fixed and a test can be written for
it if necessary.
