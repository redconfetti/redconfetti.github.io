I really find pair programming to be annoying. It seems like a waste of time as
compared to doing peer code review over a Git branch that has been [squashed].
But I really can't knock something totally unless I've tried it for a while.

Some people shared these resources today which I wanted to archive here. At
least with remote pair programming you still get to have control of your
computer, instead of sitting aside and watching idly. Here are some remote
collaborative coding tools. These could also be useful for people wanting to
remotely teach others how to code certain things.
